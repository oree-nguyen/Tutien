¹ Expected number of vertices processed by the vertex shader for one render
  pass, without considering the vertex cache.

² Expected number of vertices uploaded to GPU, assuming each Accessor
  is uploaded only once. Actual number uploaded may be higher,
  dependent on the implementation and vertex buffer layout.

³ Expected number of vertices uploaded to GPU, assuming each Primitive
  is uploaded once, duplicating vertex attributes shared among Primitives.

⁴ size estimates GPU memory required by a mesh, in isolation. If accessors are
  shared by other mesh primitives, but the meshes themselves are not reused, then
  the sum of all mesh sizes will overestimate the asset's total size. See "dedup".

⁵ gpuSize estimates minimum VRAM memory allocation. Older devices may require
  additional memory for GPU compression formats.
